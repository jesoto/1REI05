The article tried to answer the question of “What are the effects of faculty quality on PhD student outcomes””. In order to answer it, the author used data referred to the expulsion of mathematic professors in Nazi Germany. One of the strongest parts of this paper exists in this approach, it lets the author measure the effects and changes in PhD students' outcomes that the dismissal of the professor had. Furthermore, it used variables like the probability of publishing the dissertation in a top journal, the probability of becoming a full professor, the probability of having positive life citation and the number of lifetime citations to measure the PhD students outcomes. However, as the author recognized, there had been some issues such as the problem of misspelling last names in the publication data and that the Web of Science reports only the first letter of the authors. Although there are some measurable problems, the paper presents a good work estimating its objective. 
As the author said, it is known that university quality is highly important for a successful professional career of their graduates, and it's also known that it is difficult to measure university quality. Beacuase of that, Waldinger proposed and make an academic contribution using the dismissal of mathematics professors in Nazi Germany as a source of exogenous variation in university quality. He found, first, that the dismissal of mathematics professors had a considerable effect on university quality, and secondly, that faculty quality had a very sizable effect on the career of former PhD students. For example, a one-standard-deviation increase in average faculty quality has the next effect: the probability of publishing the dissertation in a top journal increases by about 13 percentage points, increases the probability of becoming a full professor by about 10 percentage points, increases of lifetime citation by 6.3 and increase the probability of having a positive lifetime citation by 16 percentage points. 
Finally, it is important to remember that this paper works specifically with mathematic german faculties. Based on that, it will be a good step for researchers to applied the knowledge in other faculties or countries-it would be interesting seeing if the correlation of being successful and having a PhD in each country's top universities have the same effect in each country.
