Human capital turns out to be a very important factor in determining the amount of production in a nation and consequently the increase in its GDP. In this sense, faculty quality plays an important role in the training of professionals, such as PhD students. That is why Waldinger's article is based on examining the effects of faculty quality on the results of PhD students, delimiting those with PhDs in mathematics. To carry out his investigation, he uses the expulsion of mathematics teachers in Nazi Germany as an exogenous variant, because this will be useful for identifying the effect of faculty quality.

For the study of the question presented, Waldinger takes a large number of historical sources to construct the data for his analysis of it. Among the most important are a compilation covering the total of students who obtained their PhD in mathematics from a German university between 1923-1938 and data on all German mathematics professors including their publication and citation records. Evidently, given that the data was made years after the events examined in question had taken place and due to the same circumstances that the different actors went through, they are not data that fully reflect the cases to be considered or omit important data that would allow greater objectivity in the case study.

However, one of its main strengths lies in the fact that it demonstrates the reliability of its results and conclusions presented. He showed a study with those alternate variables that could affect his main research factors, such as the gender of the students, and their origin (whether they are foreigners, or have Jewish ancestry), and compared the influence of the latter on their access to the labor field. as full-time professors, the impact of their research, and so on. In this way, it is consecrated with a relatively more complete study than its predecessors on the subject exposed.

Although when examining the educational quality of the universities, it takes the main factor of the professors, it leaves aside aspects of infrastructure, alliances of the university with others internationally, competition for access to vacancies to carry out their PhD in mathematics or the economic condition of the students. These variables would be relevant since they are also factors to consider in the choice of which university the students attend and their bases for obtaining job opportunities.

One of the main contributions within the investigated topic lies in measuring the effect of educational quality from the perspective of the expulsion of mathematics teachers in Germany. This is because it tries to highlight the impact of the consequences of the loss of a very important human capital for the educational development of Germany, in the short and long term. Although the perspective at first glance does not seem like such a striking approach, in reality, it is quite the opposite, since it serves to explain the reason for the decline in research in the field of mathematics and its current backward position in said field, despite having been an of the nations with the highest prestige in the study of mathematics.


The steps to follow to move forward on this issue would lie in evaluating the impact it had on GDP during those years. Since it is an area as important as mathematics, its technological processes must have had a significant delay after the absence of trained personnel and the investigations left incomplete by the expulsion of mathematics teachers. It would also be necessary to evaluate the GDP of Germany with those countries where the expelled teachers went to arrive, to evaluate the importance of human capital in the development of the nation and more efficient production.
