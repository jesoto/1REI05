The research focus on how does the faculty quality affects PhD student outcomes, for that purpose, he uses the case of the effect of dismissal Jewish or unreliable mathematics professors in Nazi Germany. 

The research mention that the outcome of PhD students is highly dependent of the quality of their faculties, and therebefore their teachers, for that reason the dismissal of some of the best professors they had, just basing on their ascestry, affected negatively in the the outcome of Germany PhD students. In my opinion focusing on this specific case to explain may certainly be a great way to measure the importance of educational quality in universities. However, the researcher mentions that there is missing some data because, taking in consideration war time, it was really difficult to obtain certain information.

The paper indicates that even with the differences of talent and effort in PhD students it is able to show that the faculty quality has a strong effect in the mayority of faculties. 
I consider that we're not able to compare the absence of a particular group of people that frequently, if we think about women, black people and minorities it would be probably more difficult to measure how would affect their absence nowadays in the educational field. Its for its particularity that this paper works very well. 

Either way the possibility of not being able to study similar cases may be or not good but gives its point to the research. It contributes to stablish a better knowledge about the topic.
It is mentioned in the paper that the autor considers that his paper is "the first to investigate the effects of university quality on PhD student outcomes using credibly exogenous variation in quality" (Waldinger 2010: 6). Maybe the next steps to move forward could be to collect more data about similar situations and cases, when its posible, so we would be able to compare if the results found in this research are the same in other cases and study how to implement and improve the quality of the faculties by its own, and the university itself, so it depends not that much of the professor's availability to teach in a particular university.
