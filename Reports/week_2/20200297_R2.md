•	What is the research question of the article?

The research question is: What is the effect of faculty quality on doctoral student outcomes using credible exogenous sources?

•	What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach to responding to that question?

The strengths are based on the statistical data they present, the organization of the data, focusing on countries and years, makes it easy to understand the way in which student performance has been changing over time. In the same way, an advantage is that the data collected is not from a recent period, on the contrary, it is from the 1920s, this allows the analysis not only to be of its short-term progress, but also in the long term. This is advantageous considering that many of them ended up publishing scientific articles years after the 1920s. Likewise, if we read the research question, we see that the study based on the use of exogenous sources is mentioned, this is also an advantage in the measure that objectifies the investigation by bringing to the field of investigation factors that could easily be overlooked but are extremely important.

On the other hand, regarding the weaknesses of the document, we can mention the centralized study. Although it is a well-executed study, we can affirm that it cannot be generalized since it only takes into account first world countries that face different circumstances. In this sense, there is always a bias that can harm the results. On the other hand, although exogenous sources help to a certain extent the objective of the research, there are still many loose points, independent variables that can also have some impact on the development of doctoral students. IN other words, what assures us that all ways of measuring student outcomes are totally reliable? It would be necessary to debate if everything that is planted is totally reliable and effective.

•	How does this document advance knowledge about the question, i.e., what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and the referees decided to publish the article).

I can mention that the main contribution is the fact of demonstrating the way in which the quality of the faculty affects the development of doctoral students, which is practically the main idea of the paper. However, there is an interesting contribution, and that is that it also adds a new variable that can be studied in the long term and has to do with the most experienced researchers. The paper mentions that in a doctoral researcher with a long experience it does not depend on the quality of the faculty, but rather that by having more elaborate professional networks they acquire independence from quality. However, in the case of those who do not have this network, they depend on the quality of the faculty. This is an interesting point that can open more research in the future, taking into account networks and professional contacts.

•	What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?
An interesting step that can make this question extend even more can focus on a comparative analysis with today. Do today's doctoral students really depend on the quality of the faculty for their development? With globalization, technological progress, human beings are increasingly self-sufficient, which can be a determining factor in the changing needs of students. It could be that today the dependency relationship between the variables studied is not as intense as in the 1920s. In this way, the exogenous sources would change and the results would open the way to a new debate on the matter.
