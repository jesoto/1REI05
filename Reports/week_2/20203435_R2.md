Attending a better university is likely to improve students' future outcomes, as it can provide them with better skills and contacts. Waldinger, the author of this article, aims to study the positive relationship between university quality and the results of a particular population, PhD students in mathematics from Nazi Germany. However, he stresses that it is difficult to know if this is a causal relationship. This doubt is due to three reasons: the best universities are likely to attract the best students, it is difficult to observe the quality of the laboratories – a factor that can positively influence student performance – and the difficulties of measuring university quality. For this reason, he proposes the dismissal of mathematics professors promoted by the Nazi regime as a source of exogenous variation in university quality. What this paper seeks to answer is how the dramatic drop in university quality, after professors were eventually fired, affected the results of PhD students in departments that did have firings versus those that did not. 

The professors were fired because the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service was enacted on April 7, 1933. The law stated that professors who were Jewish, of Jewish descent, or “politically unreliable” had to stop working. The mathematics faculties of the different universities were affected in different ways by the dismissals. In some, there were none, while in others 50% of their staff left. Waldiger estimates that approximately 18% of all professors were fired between 1933 and 1934, among them renowned mathematicians. On the other hand, the study considers students who received their PhD in mathematics at a German university between 1923 and 1938. The author defines three outcomes for these students: a dummy variable indicating whether the student published their dissertation in a top journal, a dummy variable that returns 1 if the student becomes a full professor during his/her career, number of citations (over a lifetime) in mathematics journals and positive citations over a lifetime. 

Some of the results were as follows. Before 1933, the probability of publishing the dissertation in a top journal is always greater than 0.4 in departments that later experienced layoffs; students who graduated from that same department in 1933 were much less likely to have their dissertation published in a top journal. Likewise, the probability of having positive lifetime citations is always greater before 1933 in departments with above-average quality; however, after that year the probability declines. In conclusion, the analysis suggests that the outcomes of PhD students in the affected departments deteriorated after the dismissal of high-quality professors. 

There are two important contributions of this paper. The first, more methodological, is that he was the first to investigate the effects of university quality on the outcomes of PhD students using credible and exogenous variations in quality. The second is that the results suggest that, even in highly selective educational markets, the quality of instruction is very important for future results. This is particularly informative for analyzing today's thriving research communities since it would be the quality of the faculty and not the programs that would have the greatest positive effect on the future life of the students. 
However, a weakness that I find in the approach is precisely the exogenous variable that it uses: the dismissal of professors in Nazi Germany. If at some point you want to carry out the study in another period of time and with other countries to update it, it would not be possible because you would not have the same exogenous variable that generates variations in the quality of the faculty. 

The paper demonstrates that the quality of the faculty affects the outcomes of PhD students. The next step may be to find out what effects this had on German GDP and productivity at the time. If we take into account the function of GDP per worker, we see that there is a direct connection with human capital per worker, that is, if there was a drop in this factor due to layoffs, it is expected that there would also have been an effect on GDP. Another interesting step would be to carry out similar research for countries that do not have highly selective educational markets such as Germany.
