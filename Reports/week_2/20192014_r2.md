# REPORT 2
The research seeks to find an answer to the question about the impact the dismissal of university mathematics professors between 1923 and 1938 had on the results of doctoral students during the Nazi government. This question requires the use of a series of variables, among the most highlighted by the author throughout the research is the variable "Faculty quality", of which Waldinger himself is aware of his own limits: we are talking about a relatively difficult variable to measure. At this point I must point out that it has been a good choice to choose the number of publications and citations in the entire international community to measure the variable because it influences the academic productivity of professors; he has also managed to explain in detail his entire methodological process to find causality between the independent and dependent variables (the use of dummies, creation of formulas to average citations, measurement of productivity, etc.). On the other hand, the return of the variable "Faculty quality" is a double-edged sword, although it is essential to determine the effects on the results of doctoral students, I think it is important to emphasize that it is quite difficult to measure it and probably other aspects that can help to measure it more accurately are being overlooked. 

After World War II, Jewish history has been one of the most studied subjects among historians, and not for nothing. Trying to recapture some of that lost history after the dark years of Jewish life under the Nazi government is really the responsability of the entire international community. I found it fascinating that the author recovers the contribution of great Jewish mathematicians who were left aside by the Nazi government, but who were revalued during this paper. One of the aspects perhaps not much studied has been the one that Waldinger proposed as the central theme of his research, even one of the limitations of his data is the missing information that could not be recorded on the number of Jews who left his studies, so he was forced to use data that only included students who completed their doctoral studies. In addition to it, I think his greatest contribution has been to identify how much the German academic world suffered after the expulsions of great Jewish professors, because he was able to show that the departure of all these professors had long-term effects on the PhD students, and also how poorly the Nazis judged such a decision and how ridiculous it made them look to make such arbitrary decisions on a discriminatory basis.

Waldinger did a good job demonstrating that methodological processes add credibility to the results of his research (it is evident that his methodology has been influenced by behaviorism: the use of variables, formulas and statistical procedures). The mathematization of the problem allowed him to find a positive relationship between Faculty quality and PhD student outcomes; although personally, I would have appreciated his work even more if he had made greater use of descriptive analytical methods. Now, the next step the author could take would be to make a comparative analysis between this case and other totalitarian governments of today to see if these patterns of arbitrary dismissals on the basis of racial discrimination are still maintained and to see if it produces similar results in university quality and PhD student outcomes (although it would be a more ambitious and larger scale work).
