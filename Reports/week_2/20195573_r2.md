REPORT OF THE ARTICLE: “Quality matters: the expulsion of professors and the consequences for PhD student outcomes in Nazi Germany”

The main objective of this article is to demonstrate the influence of faculty quality in the outcomes of PhD students using the expulsion of mathematic professors in Nazi Germany. To achieve this goal, this article uses different historical sources of information to construct the data. The main source is a compilation covering the universe of student who obtained their PhD in mathematics from a German university between 1923 and 1938. In addition, it uses data on all German mathematics professors including their publication and citation record, and many sources about dismissal professors.

 In this way, we can stablish as strengths of this investigation the variety of information that allowed the author to construct more reliable and accurate data. Moreover, this article allows us to have a more widely perspective of this issue by providing us both the short and long-term repercussions in the outcome of PhD students and the effects on four different areas of academic results. In addition, I consider that the inclusion of other factors, as female and foreign cases, leads to a better analysis of the real impact of this issue. On the other hand, I consider that this article has some weaknesses like the limited access to measure other variables that could have influenced in the results obtained. As the author said, there are omitted variables as the selection of inherently better students into better universities and the quality of laboratories or possible measurement errors of the faculty quality variable. These factors could have biased the results of the investigation. 

Despite this, I believe this is an important research because it shows a fundamental, but not deeply studied, aspect of the Nazi Germany. When we study Nazi Germany, we usually take more in consideration political, economic and social aspects, but we rarely observe the short and long-term impact of this regime in the education. With this article, we have a more closely approach to the effects of the racist ideology and laws in both the faculty quality of the mathematic PhD programs and in the academic repercussions of Jewish professors and students. Furthermore, the article explores the negative repercussions of this period on the German science and the production of mathematics on the best German universities. As the Author established, because of this racial law, many of the most eminent mathematicians of the time have been expulsed, which clearly had a strong repercussion on the faculty quality, PhD student outcomes and the general mathematic level in Germany compared with other countries.

In this way, I consider that in order to keep investigating about this topic and rather or not their effects continued much later in time, we should keep evaluating the progression of faculty quality in German universities since 1933. In addition, it would be interesting to evaluate the academic level of the professors that were students of PhD programs in the Nazi Germany. The author mentioned that many of the PhD students obtained high school teacher diploma. Therefore, we could evaluate the performance of those professors and their students to make a comparison with classes before Nazi Germany. 

In conclusion, this article allows us to consider an essential topic of the Nazi Germany: The repercussion of racial laws in the quality of mathematics education in a short and long-term. In my opinion, this article must be used as a base to further studies to determine the tremendous effects of this period in the academic level of students, professors and Germany in general even to our time.
