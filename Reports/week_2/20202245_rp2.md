What is the research question of the article?

This research has as its research question the effect of faculty and faculty quality on short-term and long-term doctoral student outcomes as a result of layoffs in Nazi Germany.
Exogenous variation in faculty quality and student-faculty ratio are used to estimate their effect on short-term and long-term student outcomes. This same is provided by the expulsion of mathematics teachers in Nazi Germany. The results obtained are reflected in the probability of publications in prestigious journals, becoming a full professor, having positive citations for life and the number of these.
 
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the document's approach in responding to that question?

In the first place, the strengths found in the research lie in the approach that it gives to the results of the exogenous variable. According to these, the author avoids falling into the error of attributing the results to external variables such as the drop in the reputation of German universities after 1933. With the above, the author tries to find a way out of that variable, so finds the following justification: If the reputation of the universities with dismissals did not decline sharply, it is likely that the variable is not the reputation of the universities and eventual discrimination, but rather an alteration in the human capital received by doctoral students during their training. And attending a high-quality doctoral program has real effects on the human capital of doctoral students.
In addition to this, the document has a very varied computer base in terms of data of the object of study. In this case, it data the Ph.D. students, the math layoffs, the list of professors, and find a measure of faculty quality based on the computed base.
Finally, one of the strengths is that the author's research already exists in a similar approach but with different results. This works as a reference in research, so its innovation, in a similar approach but with a different object of study in terms of consequences, helps as a significant contribution and greater information and experience on the subject.

Secondly, among the weaknesses of this research are disadvantages that the results may be biased due to factors such as the eligibility of the university due to motivation and talent, which is a variable unrelated to what was studied. In addition, there is an omitted but important factor that is the quality of the laboratory, since this favors the productivity of the research and the eventual performance of the students, among more types of external variables that can influence the results and that for various reasons are not considered. have considered.
And another of these weaknesses is the measurement error, due to the fact that it is extremely difficult to obtain measures for university quality that reflect the aspects of university quality that are really important for doctoral students. This measurement error cannot be eliminated, but it can be reduced, which is a disadvantage for research.


How does this document advance knowledge about the question, i.e. what is the contribution? (If you can't find any contributions, ask yourself why the editor and referees decided to publish the article.)

The contributions of the article are varied, but one of the main advances clearly lies in the contrast that the research has with the results of Waldinger's research years ago. The previous article investigates how the dismissal of teachers affected the productivity of teachers who remained in Germany after 1933. In this research, the dismissals do not affect the productivity of the teachers who remain. The latter predicts that department quality is not important for experienced researchers who already have a professional network outside their university. However for doctoral students, who do not have a network of contacts outside their university, they depend on studying with high-quality professors. And a low quality of the latter is directly related to the results of doctoral students. Both investigations together work in a complementary way for a contribution to the approach. With this, the author seeks to explain and show the importance of university quality and teaching staff in the results of doctoral students. These results do not depend solely on the individual performance of the student, but on external factors but related to them that affect them indirectly or directly in their professional future. In this way, it highlights the importance of teachers in a context even in universities of prestige.

What would be one or two specific and valuable next steps to move forward on this question?

To move forward and solve the research question, it could be dealt with on a larger basis, in this case, not only dedicated to the investigation of the effect of the dismissal of mathematics professors, since when talking about doctoral students, focusing on the faculty of mathematics is not significant enough to achieve a complete understanding of the full effect for the explanation of the results of the exogenous variable.
A second step lies in trying to consider other external variables that have been omitted in this research. Trying to consider them could reduce the measurement error and improve the representativeness of the results.
