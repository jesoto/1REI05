In the texts presented, a theme is addressed that may be the center of comparison between the two. We are talking about quality of life, it is to our knowledge, that as a result of COVID-19 it has greatly impacted the well-being of people worldwide. Under this criterion in the text of the World Hapines Report 2021, the well-being of society is studied subjectively in order to see the quality of life worldwide, on the other hand, in the Macroeconomics book we can also see a certain analysis of the quality of life worldwide, but with the difference that it focuses on seeing the relationship between GDP and quality of life, this being a much less subjective factor.

In the first instance, in the happiness report we see that through the Gallup World Poll they group people more specifically. They take into account age, gender, immigration status, income, unemployment and general health. Under these criteria is that the survey differentiates the quality of life, having a separation between positive and negative affect, the report studies these different groups along with the impact that the pandemic had on them. So, you can see in which countries people were happier, in addition, among these people who were happy, the report also groups them into groups with common characteristics.

However, in the text of Macroeconomics, it takes into account the GDP of each country, and tries to put the level of GDP as an explanatory variable, with quality of life being a variable dependent on it. It is a simple logic, the more money the greater happiness, at first glance it may sound logical, however, there are countries that do not present this pattern, clear cases that we see presented in the book show that even with a low GDP there are countries that are happier than countries with high GDP. And this is because subjective aspects are not taken into account, these subjective aspects are necessary to identify the level of quality of life. With GDP alone it is not possible to ensure that people are happy. It can be a good predictor, but it is still relative, so it is necessary to study many more factors that GDP clearly does not take into account. COVID 19 is an example of these factors, and it is that with the pandemic the level of quality has changed remarkably, for which we cannot forget the situation within the subject. It is the first text that studies these factors and the statistics change, compared to only using the GDP, therefore, it must be taken into account that the subjective part of the report is very necessary within the formality of the GDP.
