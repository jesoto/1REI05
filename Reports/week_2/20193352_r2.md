Nazi ideology had a profound effect on German society beginning in 1933 with the election of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany. One area in which this influence manifests itself is that of mathematics. Indeed, the Nazi influence on mathematics was seen from different angles, starting with the treatment of mathematicians of “unfavorable ethnicity”, that is, the Jews. The passage of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service on the 7th of April 1933 mandated that civil servants of “non-Aryan” descent were to be removed from office. This directly affected many mathematicians teaching in German universities, who lost their posts and were forced to emigrate. 

Undoubtedly, quality is an essential element when talking about education. In this sense, Waldinger is going to investigate the great effect that the expulsion of professors from the mathematics faculty had in Nazi Germany, as well as the consequences that this caused for PhD students in the short and long term. To respond to this assumption, use is made of the exogenous variation that allows addressing the endogeneity of the quality of the teaching staff. Likewise, the quality of the faculty is taken as a crucial factor in this research since it is an important determinant of the results of doctoral students.
In the same way, it is considered that a decrease in the quality of the faculty would bring therefore the probabilistic increase of publishing the dissertation in one of the best journals, the probability of becoming a full professor, and the probability of having positive lifetime citations.

In this sense, within this research, one of the strengths mentioned by the author was that many historical sources were used. In this way, data was obtained from doctoral students from the 1920s and 1930s, which allowed for short- and long-term results. In addition, strengths have been found in answering this question related to the scope of the results of the exogenous variable. This is because the author considers variables such as the sex and nationality of the teachers to explain his research in more detail. Since he had a long database, he was also able to compare such results with teachers' access to the labor market and with other objectives of his research.


However, when giving such precise results, weaknesses are found because it is difficult to form quality measures that accurately exemplify the aspects of university quality that demonstrate what is important for PhD students. This is because there are imprecise results that increase the bias due to measurement error. In addition, another weakness is that it has been possible to have a limited number of variables, this could have influenced the result.

The author claims that there was a drop in the university quality of PhD students after the regime fired math professors. This leads us to think about the contributions of the article. The author seeks to publicize a situation that affected a large part of its population and that was not well attended to at the time. Waldinger wants to make visible the importance of university quality in the results of PhD students. 


An important step to advance in the question would be to find out a little more about the socioeconomic variables of that moment. As a starting point what was the effect of the law imposed by the Nazi regime on the GDP of that year and why did it affect more citizens than expected.
