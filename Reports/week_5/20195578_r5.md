The increase in the minimum wage: blessing or curse for social inclusion in 
Peru?

The purpose of the work of Dr. Miguel Jaramillo Baanante, entitled "Peruvian 
labor market adjustments to changes in the minimum wage: The experience of the 
2000s" consists of evaluating the effects of increases in the minimum vital 
wage on wages and employment, using the information provided by the experience 
of the 2000s.

The strength of the academic work consists in the use of the diversification 
of the analysis to competently develop the object of study. The descriptive 
analysis presents the significant growth of the minimum wage since the second 
half of the 1990s. There is a strong correlation between the level of the 
minimum wage and the non-compliance rate. It should be noted that, when 
analyzing the minimum living wage, it is important to consider the enormous 
heterogeneity in productivity levels throughout the country, reflected in wage 
levels. In this direction, the focus area of this analysis, Metropolitan Lima, 
stands out for having the highest remuneration levels and the lowest levels of 
non-compliance. The results presented constitute the most comprehensive 
evaluation of the Peruvian experience with the minimum wage in the last decade. 
On the other hand, we notice through the graphical analysis that there are no 
effects of the minimum wage that have a considerable impact on the 
distribution of wages. Through the econometric analysis, the few effects 
that are identified tend to be limited to specific groups, such as formal 
wage earners who earn around the level of the minimum wage. Probably, the 
little that is known and has been collected regarding the effects of minimum 
wages is a "weakness" for the work of Dr. Miguel Jaramillo Baanante. The 
existing evidence does not provide conclusive support on the potential 
beneficial effects of increases in the minimum living wage on wages and 
employment.

Three contributions to the literature regarding minimum wages in the country 
are recognized. In the first place, the implemented methodologies allow us to 
exploit all the variations of the minimum living wage that have occurred 
during the 2000s. It is important to emphasize that this type of evaluation 
has not been previously carried out for the Peruvian case, because only the 
effects of some individual increments have been studied. Second, by using 
longitudinal data we note a number of changes in labor market variables for 
individuals affected and unaffected by changes in the minimum wage. Finally, 
effects in both the formal and informal sectors are analyzed. With all that is 
proposed, it is intended to expand knowledge about how the minimum wage 
operates in the Peruvian labor market and to what extent it can contribute to 
the equity objectives in the name of which it is implemented. Dr. Miguel 
Jaramillo concludes that the active policy of minimum wages is a tool that 
lacks effectiveness to promote social inclusion, in a context in which 
non-compliance with labor regulations and labor informality are high.

The universe of research on minimum wages in Peru is so limited to the point 
that, in the last two decades, it is estimated that only a couple of events of 
increases in the minimum wage have been studied: that of September 2003 and 
the January 2006. It continues to be applied under the presumption that the 
effects of increases in the minimum living wage on wages and employment are 
socially desirable. Its effectiveness is particularly doubtful in a context in 
which non-compliance with labor regulations and labor informality are high. A 
couple of studies are not enough to determine great findings. In this sense, 
the debate on the effects of this policy instrument could be enriched with 
further studies, such as, for example, investigating whether or not it 
increases the remuneration of those who earn less, since it has no effect on 
those who earn less than the salary wage and on workers in the informal sector, 
or investigate whether its effects on employment are really concentrated in 
the informal or formal sector and in workers who earn above or below the 
minimum wage.
