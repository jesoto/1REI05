# The uncertain scenario for startups and young firms as generators of employment in the US

The main theme of the paper is the economic dynamism of the US and its dependence on the creation of companies. We are aware that the United States has one of the most dynamic economies in the world, which is why it is believed that they have a high resilience to the economic downturns that they may experience. However, the text brings to light the worrying situation that characterizes the current US economy, and that is that there is a clear decrease in the creation of companies, which slows down the economic dynamism to which it was accustomed. This is worrying to the extent that start-ups and young companies contribute to job creation.

When establishing new companies, competition in the market increases, which allows the constant change in the economy, this in the same way contributes to the growth of productivity, although it is difficult to determine the optimum point of dynamism based on the creation of new companies. , the article shows with certainty that in recent decades the US economy has fallen along with business dynamics. Consequently, in the last decade, despite its great relevance in previous years, the role of small businesses is decreasing. It is quite difficult to explain the specific reasons, because the relevance of startups and young companies in employment is a very complex aspect. In the first instance, the article makes us notice that although emerging companies are of great importance in the US, most of them do not even have the opportunity to grow, so the creation of immediate jobs is limited, it is even too much. difficult for even these companies to survive in such a competitive market.

Faced with this daunting scenario, it is much more difficult for those who promote entrepreneurship to succeed, because at this point start-ups are no longer the main generators of employment despite the fact that they are still very relevant. On the other hand, the entire article makes it clear to us that the creation of startups and emerging companies has decreased considerably, however, it does not make it clear why. It may be due to the change in the industrial composition, even the dynamism of migratory flows may be a cause of all this problem, but frankly it is not possible to determine it with certainty.

It also emphasizes the construction of a professional career, this being a highly debated point in recent decades, due to the structural change in the economic scenario, the slowdown in the construction of careers has been increased, this means that there are less chances of creating new jobs. for young people so the number of emerging companies is also in decline, with all this it is clear that there is less mobility in the US economy due to various factors but all of these are reduced to the young population and the difficulties they have in such a competitive and complex scenario
