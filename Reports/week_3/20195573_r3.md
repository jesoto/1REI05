Tittle: Report of the article " “The role of entrepreneurship in US Job creation and Economic Dynamism"

This article examines a current concert: the loss of dynamism in the US economy. The United States is well known as one of the most flexible and adaptive economies in the world. However, in recent years, this capacity to face changing economic circumstances and recover form recessions have been reduced. In this way, this article’s main purpose is to determine the effect of the declining business startup rates in the US economic dynamism. 

In order to achieve this goal, this article uses many sources for the construction of data. First, they use The Business Dynamic Statics and the Longitudinal Business Database to identify the true “starups” and distinguish them from other types of business, which make the analysis more precise. Other useful source  is the Business Employment Dynamic from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics wich provides complete information about job creation and destruction but is less useful for studying firm size and age effects. Moreover, the authors use other sources of data describing firm dynamics as COMPUSTAT, The National Establishment Time Series and the Kauffman Survey. Lastly, this article collect data from previous investigations and information about this topic. In this way, this article uses different types of information to show, trough statistic graphics and tables, the importance of entrepreneurship for the US economic dynamism and its decline across time.

This article presents three main conclusions. First, it stablishes that startups and young businesses play a fundamental role in job creation. Between 1980 and 2010, they accounted 18% of the workforce and the average net job creation in US private sector was 1.4 million Jobs per year. Moreover, even though  they normally present a decline in job creation trough the years and they have a higher rate of job destruction (50% of the jobs are lost in a five-year firm), the still represent a powerful driver of job growth than mature firms. Second, this article stablishes that the evidence of the contribution of startup firms to overall productivity growth is less. This is connected to the growth and survival dynamics of firms. The startup firms starts with no more than 20 employees and over time they normally remain the same. Others do not get to experience a real growth or simply disappear in some years. In this way, they do not really contribute in productivity because 60% of the productivity growth happens within existing establishments. Finally, the article explains that since 2000’s, the rate of startup firms started to decline, which consequently made the business dynamism (pace of job creation and destruction) decline too. The causes of the decline in startup are not specified in this article. The authors only give some ideas like the decline in incentives to star new business, the change in business climate and state regulations, the expansion of “big box” retailer and large national firms, and other non-regional factors.

In conclusion, this article showed the importance of the startup and young business in the US business dynamism and the negative effects due to its decline over the years. In my opinion, this article discusses an important issue in the growth of a country economy: entrepreneurships. In this way, we can use this research to evaluate the importance of encouraging the creation of new business in the youth to contribute to the economic dynamism and growth.
