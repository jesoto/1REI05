Decker, Haltiwanger, Jarmin and Miranda in their article “The role of entrepreneurship in US job creation and economic dynamism”, pay special attention to the startups and young businesses -as they represent entrepreneurship and are different from new establishments of old firms-. In this way, the authors approach is to measure entrepreneurship by age rather than by size. Furthermore, they also make a difference between subsistence entrepreneurs, a kind of small business of a small group of people to survive, and transformational entrepreneurs that are “small startup business with intention to innovate and grow, creating more employment and value added for the economy. After conceptualisation, the authors present some importants outcomes in their study. 
Firstly, they try to see the effects of new business in the creation of jobs. They found that young firms exhibit a strong “up or out” dynamic. That is that young firms show high levels of failure that have as a result high levels of job destruction. However, the level of net job creation is almost at the same level. Based on that, they concluded that even if most startups fail and those that survive do not grow, there are a few surviving startups that became high-growth firms that contribute disproportionately to job growth. 
Secondly, they try to see the participation of startups reallocation and productivity. In this case, the evidence is less positive for young businesses. They do not find that startups have low levels of contribution to overall productivity growth. Instead, when they study the startup rate, the study shows not only that the overall activity of young firms in the economy is declining but the share of activities for which they account is declining too. 
The authors explore the reasons that might cause this decline in the participation of young firms. For example, they talk about exploring entrepreneurial activity within groups or changing patterns of entrepreneurial activity by US regions and states. However, as they found that this decline is general there have to be other variables. Finally, they conclude that they do not have an answer for the decline in the pace of entrepreneurship. after making some hipotesis or recommendations for future studies in this topic.
