In recent decades, business dynamism has slowed in the US, as evidenced by the decline in both the rate of business creation and the pace of job creation and destruction. This downward trend accelerated after 2000. This article proposes that a key factor in explaining the decline in business dynamics is a lower rate of business creation, as well as the declining role of young and dynamic businesses in the economy. To support this argument, it is mentioned that the proportion of US employment represented by young companies has decreased by almost 30 percent in the last 30 years. This has been measured as the pace of job creation and destruction and the flows of workers between companies. These data demonstrate that the incentives for entrepreneurs to start new businesses in the United States have decreased over time.

The authors present the United States as an enterprising country with a consolidated and very dynamic economy. It is due to its flexible nature that this country is considered as one that manages to adapt to various changing economic situations, even one that has been able to recover from recessions. While much support is shown for such an argument, the outcomes of entrepreneurship are more mixed than is commonly believed. This is due to the decline in business creation, which makes the US economy less and less dynamic. Due to this, the role of young and dynamic companies in the economy was diminished as a consequence. Startups account for about 20 percent of gross creation of employment in the US, while high-growth companies account for nearly 50 percent of gross job creation. To assess this impact, the authors analyze the length of service on the size of the companies, as well as their age. Indeed, although Startups and young firms are important contributors to job creation and productivity growth, this contribution is a noisy and complex process.

 However, startups and young companies are small. A small fraction of young companies shows very high growth and contribute substantially to job creation. These high-growth companies offset almost all the job losses associated with the downsizing and exit of companies within their cohort. In this sense, this dynamic is critical, as each incoming cohort of startups makes a lasting contribution to net job creation. however, most start-ups fail and many that survive do not grow. But among the surviving startups are high-growth companies that contribute disproportionately to job growth. These young, high-growth companies produce the lasting contribution of new businesses to net job creation. Nevertheless, most startups fail and many that survive do not grow. But among the surviving startups are high-growth companies that contribute disproportionately to job growth. These young, high-growth companies produce the lasting contribution of new businesses to net job creation.


The role of small businesses is declining, as is full employment and its rate of reallocation, exit, entry, expansion, and contraction. It is quite difficult to explain the concrete reasons why this has happened. This situation poses an important challenge, since most young and small companies are not the main creators of jobs, and it would not be appropriate to seek to promote job creation by promoting Business spirit. The decline in business dynamism is a serious problem because a dynamic economy requires the continuous reallocation of the factors of production towards the most efficient companies.
