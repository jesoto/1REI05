# REPORT 3
The research "The Role of Entrepreneurship in US Job Creation and Economic Dynamism" aims to explore into a recent problem in the US economy: the progressive decline in the creation of startups and young businesses. The authors demonstrate throughout the paper that it is of utmost importance to analyze this issue because it is startups and young businesses that play an important role in job creation (startups create 20% of US jobs), which in turn threatens the economic dynamism for which this country is characterized. 

The paper shows that productivity is also positively affected (with an increase) by young businesses, due to the role they play in innovative activity, which is much higher compared to mature firms. Startups also contribute to the generation of jobs in the short term, but the problem is in the long term when many of them withdraw from the market because they fail and those that survive do not have the interest in high growth and do not contribute as much to job creation in the US, it was even recorded that after 5 years half of the jobs generated would be lost. However, the decline in the startup rate has another worrying consequence on the pace of reallocation in labor markets. Taken together, all of this has affected the dynamism of the U.S. economy. In fact, the authors provide some hypotheses about the possible causes of the decline in entrepreneurial and dynamism activity and the likely consequences in each of them. But, again, it must be emphasized that these are "possible causes" as they are not certain. The first offers a scenario in which the business climate has changed, hindering the job reallocation. Another possibility is that the use of churning of jobs and firm has become irrelevant for firms in responding to shocks. And the last possibility is somewhere in between the previous two. The limitations of the data leave this in the realm of possibility and leave the door open for further research.

It is important to note that even international organizations have pronounced themselves on the subject, among them the World Bank, which according to research has concluded that startups are an essential component for the growth of an economy. Another limitation of the research addressed in this report is that it is not known how the decline of these startups and the dynamism of the economy indicate a reduction in the number of entrepreneurs in the US. Also, the authors cannot provide an explanation for the decline in the pace of entrepreneurship which reduces the contribution of the answer to the research question and leaves a somewhat discouraging scenario for the U.S. economy.
