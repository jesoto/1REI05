Historically, the dynamism of the United States has been evident when facing unexpected economic changes such as recessions and its unusual way of overcoming this type of situation. However, unlike previous decades, it can be seen that little by little this characteristic of dynamism has been reduced. In this article, the authors argue that this slowdown in the US economy is related to the decline in entrepreneurship in that nation.

In this sense, the authors evaluated considering the low frequency of emerging companies and young companies as a variable. Because from the data used it is determined that these two types of companies play a determining role in the net creation of employment, an elementary point for the dynamism characteristic of the United States.

To explain the impact of the two types of companies mentioned, it must first be considered that for the purposes of this research, the classification of companies will be determined based on the age of the company. Considering this age factor, it can be glimpsed that there is a continuing pattern where younger companies have much higher rates of employment growth than more mature companies. "Together, startups and high-growth companies account for about 70 percent of gross company-level job creation in a typical year."

However, it is these same young companies that at the same time have a substantially higher exit rate
highest. Their failure rate is 50%, and even if they manage to survive the average of 5 years, this does not mean that they are assured of growth. Despite this discouraging scenario, there are exceptions, and they are those new surviving companies that obtain high growth, which makes them contribute extremely high to employment growth.

The explanation they hold for these exceptional cases is their high level of productivity and profitability. Precisely this would be the effect that it is these emerging companies that have a high level of innovation, compared to mature companies. They also explain other factors that could help these emerging companies become mature companies.

Although, evidently through his article he makes us reflect on the technological role for a good use of the human capital of a company, for its growth and positioning as a mature company. The article, at the end of all its arguments, does not end by weaving a conclusion that can respond to its main prerogative. And it even mentions that until now there are no explanations for the progressive decline of business initiatives, which calls for the investigation of this field of action.
