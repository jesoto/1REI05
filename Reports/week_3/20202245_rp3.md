This article tries to explain how the US economy is becoming less dynamic and this is largely due to the decline in the rates of new businesses in the US economy. The latter is dependent on the contribution of startups and young companies.

In the article, we are presented with the position of the United States as a strong economy and that despite possible recessions, due to its flexibility and dynamism, it tends to recover and become stronger. However, a decisive factor for this was the role played by young companies and startups in this dynamism. For the author, companies, specifically their size, should be based on their age and not their size. If we take this factor into account, it turns out that the age of the enterprises influences how they can be beneficial for the national economy. Young companies, while more likely to fail, also have the potential to be highly productive and expand easily. In doing so, they contribute to job creation.
Startups have a fundamental role in creating jobs for people. In what the author mentions, they are called as transformational entrepreneurs. That is to say, those ventures that focus on growing and giving work to large sectors of the population, for which they contribute to the US economy. 

As mentioned above, and according to the statistics presented by the author, net job creation is due to new companies. Nevertheless, this can be misleading because in a given period there are many different groups of growing firms that can be used to account for job creation. And secondly, it is essential to review and investigate the period of the dynamics after the entry of startups. For the latter, the author proposes to base it on the growth and survival of the company based on firm age. Being the age of startups zero, due to their recent creation, the author shows a relationship between the age of the company, which begins after its creation and ends when the organization no longer exists, with the destruction or growth of net employment . With the graph shown, young companies tend to generate more net employment with greater dynamism, while older companies tend to reduce net employment. So there is a relationship of decrease if the company is older and increase if the company is new. With this, the author's initial idea is corroborated. In addition to this, young companies, due to their high probability of failure, compensate for the loss of net employment with the result of the surviving companies, which eventually converts their growth into a medium one. 
Based on the entry, exit, expansion and contraction of companies, the productivity and profitability that these could produce can be predicted. Which is closely related to the dynamics of growth and survival of companies. Based on the results obtained, the author states that the productivity analyzed based on the establishments is higher in young companies than in mature ones. In this sense, productivity growth is faster for surviving young establishments, this being 60% of productivity in existing establishments. However, this is not very important in sectors such as retail where there is a reliance on labor production and the addition of new, more productive retail locations. It is important to highlight that the jobs generated by startups are 
immediate but these can be short-lived due to their high level of failure, so the effects of this are highly variable in general and difficult to understand. 

Nevertheless, the rates of new companies and business dynamism have decreased in recent years, so that full employment and the pace of reallocation, referring to entry, exit, expansion and contraction, has also decreased. According to the author, there is no certain explanation of the reasons for this and, moreover, the consequences of this are still under investigation. But as the author mentions, citing Hopenhayn and Rogerson, if an economy experiences an increase in adjustment costs due to job destruction, then there will not only be a decrease in job destruction, but also a decrease in job creation. of employment. 

But it is true that all this is reflected in other measures of dynamism in the United States. Examples of this are the decrease in internal migration since the 1980s, the turnover of workers has decreased and the process of building careers through job change has slowed down. Finally, it is necessary to conclude that despite the stable reputation of the US economy, it seems that in recent years its changing economic conditions have allowed the aforementioned consequences and the margin to control it is increasingly reduced for this country.
