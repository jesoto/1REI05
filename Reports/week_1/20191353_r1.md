This report aims to expose the main topics developed in chapter 2 of the World Happiness Report 2021. As the authors said, the purpose of this chapter was to measure the quality of life in the world but, conscious of the changes Covid-19 have brought, they also studied the effect the pandemy had on life’s quality in 2020 (Helliwell, Huang, Wang & Norton, 2021).
Firstly, the chapter presents the overall life evaluation and emotions in 2020 and contrasts it with the result of past years. In order to measure well-being, the study used three main indicators: Life evaluation, an indicator from 0 to 10 in which 0 expresses the worst possible life and, 10 the best possible; positive emotions, a dummy variable that asked whether people smiled and if they experienced enjoyment yesterday; and, negative emotions that asked if  people experienced worry, sadness and anger.
The results show that. generally, there are no relevant changes in the overall rankings of life evaluation between 2020 and past years data while positive affect did not change. However, in the case of negative emotions, the study showed a significant increase. Those results, the authors support, shows a Covid-19 effect in negative emotions but, also, great levels of resilience in the population as the life evaluation did not change significantly. 
Secondly, the authors show how covid-19 effects in happiness affect different subgroups. According to the results, age is the main factor that separates those with different risks; even though, the data indicate that in some regions, younger people reduce their perception of well-being. In addition, although those with lower income were more at risk because of the low opportunities to work at home and the necessity to work for living, the study suggests that Covid-19 reduced the effect of income in life quality. 
In this point, it is useful to mention the important role that income may have to predict life satisfaction. As Acemoglu, Libson and Lips (2019) said about macroeconomics aggregate, we can measure the GDP by calculating incomes; with this premise we would see that income is a strong predictor of life satisfaction as GDP is. They show a strong positive correlation, in other words, countries with higher levels of GDP per capita present higher levels of life satisfaction while those with lower levels of GDP show lower levels of life satisfaction.   
Thirdly, the authors pay special attention to institutional trust. They found that “individuals with high social and institutional trust levels were happier” partly because they are more resilient (Helliwell, Huang, Wang & Norton, 2021). For example, using the “wallet question”, it seems that those who think that their lost wallet might be returned by a stranger presents a higher life evaluation (+0.58 points). 
Finally, in the core of the investigation, the authors expose and explain the different responses of countries against covid-19 based on the death rates. They used two groups of variables. One that covers demographic, geographic and disease exposure circumstances at the beginning of the pandemic; and another that covers economics and social structures aspects measured before the pandemic. The main outcome in the study is that ”the most successful overall strategy for minimizing death rates has been to drive community transmission to zero and keep it there. Also it is interesting that countries that have a female leader present 19 less deaths per 100000 population. Moreover, trust level appears as an important variable again as people are more likely to understand the necessity of some politics for the overall well-being.
