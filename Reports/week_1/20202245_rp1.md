The main objective of this article is to measure and use subjective well-being to explain the quality of life around the world.
This article uses variables like geography, demographics and the spread of the virus that have interacted with scientific knowledge and the social and political foundations of each country, especially their levels of social trust to explain international differences in COVID mortality rates. The article has the following characteristics:
- First, the article evaluates general life evaluations and measures of positive and negative emotions from countries with available surveys in 2020. These rankings are then placed alongside those based on the years 2017-2019, before COVID, and a ranking figure based on the three-year average of 2018-2020 life evaluations.
- Second, the individual level is used to investigate how COVID has affected the happiness of different subgroups of the population with the objective of identifying inequalities in the distribution of the well-being consequences of COVID.
- Third, tries to investigate how  trust and well-being is expanded. Both are strong supports for wellness and strategies to overcome COVID. This is shown by the degree to which people think their wallets will be returned to strangers, neighbors or the police.
- Fourth, it examines how different characteristics of national demographic, social, and political structures have combined with consequences of political strategies and disease exposure to help explain international differences in COVID mortality rates in 2020. 

The quality of the social context, and the extent to which people trust their governments and trust the benevolence of others, supports their ability to maintain happiness before and during the pandemic and furthermore reduces the number of deaths from COVID. The latter by facilitating more effective strategies to limit the spread of the pandemic while maintaining a sense of common purpose.
According to chapter 5 of the text, GDP cannot measure people's happiness, however it can measure the satisfaction that people can have with life. According to this, countries with a higher GDP per capita are subjectively more satisfied with life than countries with a higher GDP per capita. Therefore, GDP per capita is used as a summary measure of the welfare of society and turns out to be a good predictor of life satisfaction. This is reinforced by the results of the article, in which people with lower incomes and, in general, countries with lower GDP are subjectively less happy than their counterparts with higher incomes. This is even more reinforced with the object of study of the article, that is, the consequences of COVID on people's happiness.
According to the graph of the happiness ranking from 2018 to 2020, it can be seen that the highest percentage of explanations is given by GDP, followed by social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life decisions and generosity. .
In relation to chapter 5 of the text, the results of the post-COVID happiness study show that those most prone to the consequences of COVID are not only front-line health workers or people with a delicate state of health, but also people with lower incomes since they are more likely to be in high-risk workplaces, with less opportunity to carry out work at home and with fewer resources to support those infected.
In addition to this, the study shows different patterns of consequence according to the characteristics of the respondents such as gender, age, health status, immigration status, income and unemployment. The results affirm that subjective evaluations of life are lower in people who are unemployed or with lower income categories.
Immigration status is also an important variable in this relationship, since according to the results, immigrants go to places with greater opportunities for development and with higher GDP since they tend to be happier.
However, that would mean that countries with high GDP per capita have maintained high levels of happiness, which is not entirely true. During the pandemic, the world has fallen into an economic recession in which unemployment increases, so people's happiness decreases as mentioned in the article as an important factor in people's happiness. Countries with higher unemployment are less happy, and considering that even countries with high GDP increased unemployment from 3.5 to 14.7% in just three months in the first half of 2020, according to figures from the United States, this falls for the explanation of factors external to GDP per capita. As the happiness article explains, another factor is trust in people, governments and benevolence, which makes people maintain their happiness and even reduce deaths from COVID due to a construction of common well-being between people. However, this would work mostly in countries where people's institutional and governmental trust is strong, which leads us to think again in countries with a high GDP per capita.
