# REPORT 1
Happiness in COVID times
It is quite hard to talk about happiness in COVID times, not only because is a state of mind sometimes difficult to describe but for the unexpected impact on people’s well-being during the pandemic. Last year, the World Happiness Report´s main source, the Gallup World Poll, made a big effort while trying to measure this impact even though the criteria might change comparing with other surveys due to the subjectivity of the term. For instance, surveys of this type were taken by the ONS and the Eurobarometer; in general, these two had similar results to The Gallup World Poll ones.

The report shows a comparison between collected data from past surveys from the time period 2018 – 2019 and the one made in 2020. A lot of variables were taken into account; however, most of the significant variables were trust in public institutions, unemployment, measure of the inequality of income distribution, the wallet question and COVID-19 death rates. Following the report, trust in public institutions was a crucial variable when governments were trying to give a response to COVID-19, thus people were more opened to accept fast and hard restrictions and tented to follow the rules to stop the propagation of the virus when trust was high. Another factor was unemployment, that increased during the pandemic and caused an “slightly greater average happiness loss”. The report agrees with Acemonglu, Laibson and List in this point, unemployment triggers a series of negatives effects on well-being since income paid to households helps them to get access to basic services (such as water, healthcare, etc.), when they lose this income there is not only no guarantee for them to sustain, there is also an impact on GDP growth. That is why Economists figured out a way to measure the relationship between GDP per capita and life satisfaction, finding a positive tendency and giving an explanation why we observe in the report the top happiest countries are the ones with less serious impact on their economies (like most Nordic countries) and lower levels of inequalities. It is surprising to know that some of these countries that chose restrict policies at the beginning of the pandemic are also the countries that had high trust levels and a low death rate; a totally different story are the ones who decided to prioritize its economies, now they are still struggling while trying to make successful responses to the virus. The death rates mentioned before, played an important role for being it is linked to income inequality and well-being. Evidently, COVID-19 effects were harder and deeper in countries with the highest inequalities, affecting those with lower incomes and resulting in a death rate much higher than in countries with less inequalities says the report. This is something we can criticize to GDP, for its impossibility to take this important inequality income into account while trying to “measure happiness” (but something that Gini coefficient can do measure).

The impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our lifes is irrefutable but two of the have been more altered are, without doubt, well-being and the global economy (these two closely connected). The World Happiness Report made huge contributions while trying to establish different variables that explain links among COVID-19, well-being and the economy and can be also contrastable with the information available in Macroeconomics by Acemonglu, Laibson and List.
