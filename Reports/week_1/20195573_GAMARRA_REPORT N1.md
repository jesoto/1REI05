Report of the article “World Happiness, trust and Deaths under COVID -19” and a brief comparison to the extract of Chapter 5 "Does GDP buy happiness?"

The main purpose of the article “World Happiness, trust and Deaths under COVID -19” is to measure and determine the changes and continuities of well-being and quality of lives around the world in times of COVID-19. To achieve this objective, the article uses the Gallup World Poll as a primary source to compare data from 2017-2019 with data recollected through computer-assisted telephone interviews in 2020. In addition, the article considers several indicators and variables, which will be detailed later, to evaluate entirely the well-being taking in consideration the context and conditions of each country.

First, the article used three main indicators: life evaluation, positive emotions and negative emotions. They got this information from The Gallup World Poll, where they asked people to rate their lives as a hole from 0 to 10 and to determine whether they smiled, laughed and experienced enjoyment (positive) or experienced worry, sadness or anger (negative) the day yesterday. The results show a widely shared resilience to the impact of COVID -19. This is because, even though there is a significant increase in negative effect, especially in sadness and worry, the positive effect was unchanged. In addition, following the results obtained in the ranking of happiness (average life evaluations) based on the 2020 surveys compared to those in 2017-2019, we can see that the overall life evaluations in each country were surprising stable because the order of the countries in the ranking before 2020 remained almost the same in 2020. 

Secondly, the article considered exploring variables as gender and age in order to have a more disaggregated analysis of the effects of COVID in society. The information was recollected from The ONS and they evaluated indicators as life satisfaction, happiness and anxiety yesterday and life worthwhile. In the results, they found that the lockdown during Q2 of 2020 had largest negative effects in happiness and anxiety. In addition, the survey determined that drops in life satisfaction and happiness, and the increases in anxiety were greater in women than men in the Q2. In the case of the age groups, the results show a minimum change in the indicators for the young. Furthermore, adults over 60 showed a highest level of life satisfaction while people between 30 and 59 have shown the lowest level. A surprising result is that even though people over 60 are considered population at higher risk for COVID, during 2020 this age group have reported less health problems than years before.

Thirdly, the article included an evaluation between population subgroups using factors supporting well-being as income, health, someone to count on, freedom, unemployment, foreign- born, intuitional trust, donation, and others. The results show a lower life evaluation for those with lowest income categories, unemployed and in poor health. In addition, the results have shown that the rate of happiness was higher in countries with a mayor level of institutional trust and benevolence. This is related with the increase in happiness in countries with better governmental strategies to face COVID, because of the decrease in deaths and shorter periods in lockdown.

This article have shown that there are many variables and indicators to take into consideration when evaluating well-being, happiness and quality of lives. In contrast, in the extract "Does GDP buy happiness?" in chapter 5 of the book "Macroeconomics", the authors explain that the GDP is considered as a measure of well-being of society and GDP per capita as a good predictor of human happiness and life satisfaction. However, in my opinion, GDP should not be used as the main or only indicator to determine happiness and life satisfaction. This is because, as explained in the same section of the book, GDP does not measure factors like inequality across the country and leisure, wich are important variables to determine the real levels of happiness in the country. In addition, GDP only focuses on economic variables as income and expenditure of the households. So, even though both are necessary for an increase in life expectation and happiness, other important indicators of well-being like access to education, health, work and opportunities are not considered in GDP. 

In conclusion, in my opinion, this article shows a broad, comprehensive and complete approach to the levels of well-being, happiness and life satisfaction all over the world during COVID-19. Despite the error range because of the context of pandemic, the results showed in this article demonstrate that GPD and GPD per capita are not the only indicators to consider, there are other factors that are not really included in GDP that can have a tremendous impact, positive or negative, in the happiness and well-being of the population.
