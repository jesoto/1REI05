#Report 1

In this report we compare the information exposed in chapter 5 of Macroeconomics and chapter 2 of the 2020 World Happiness Report.

In chapter 5 we can observe the question “Does GDP buy happiness?” As the book conclude, the answer cannot be a simple yes or no. The GDP its able to show us a really good indicator of happiness, as the quality of life can be related to it, however the GDP cannot be taken as the only factor that matters. In the graphics we observe that there´re some countries that demonstrate an irregular result, if we compare them to other with more wealth.

GPD is a good indicator of satisfaction, however it leaves some variables behind, there is when the results of WHR become important. The 2020 WHR report uses their own data and compares it with different surveys. It also shows us the effect of COVID 19, there we found that the mean of negative affect has grown in 2020.

The WHR report take certain indicators that could be difficult to predict, as positive and negative recent emotions of the participants of the surveys, to compare what general feeling would a country have recently. It is for its own irregular character that something as "happiness" is difficult to recall.

The WHR report announces that is certainly difficult to recall all the information necessary, because there are some people who are not usually include in surveys, as prisoners and people in hospitals, explaining that is particularly important as these people are probably the most affected in the pandemic. It also mentions that the change of methods to recollect the information, from face to face to calls by cellphone, possibly alters the results.   

The WHR report show us statistics to compare itself, for example, about some UK estimates about subgroups, where female life satisfaction is little less under the results of the male satisfaction between 2019- 2020, similar results appear in happiness indicator. The mayor impact would appear in anxiety results, where female anxiety is around 0.4 higher than the male, in the division by age we found that people over 60 has the mayor results in life satisfaction, life worthwhile and happiness while it also has the less in anxiety. 

The report mencion that top countries remained in their positions in 2020, their social conditions helped them to maintain their rankings.

We can see in both chapters that GPD and the indicators of WHR are trying to measure some things intangibles in the best form that is possible nowadays, because even if it does not show exactly what where looking for, its better an indicator with mistakes that any.
