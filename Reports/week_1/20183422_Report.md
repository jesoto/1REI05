The World Happiness, Confidence and Deaths under COVID-19 report aims to measure subjective well-being to explain quality of life. The development of this report revolves around 4 axes. For this, the Gallup survey was used as a reference; however, this presented variations since the surveys had to be carried out by telephone. The report compares Gallup's poll responses with others and found how much the overall pattern of change has been altered.
Likewise, the surveys used different questions, but this did not significantly alter the result and moderate reductions in life evaluations could be estimated. Satisfaction was found to decrease due to infections and deaths. On the other hand, people over 60 had life satisfaction before and during the pandemic. Covid-19 has altered certain factors of population groups. For example, the fact that the virus is infectious and fatally affects the elderly population has made age a main factor in this pandemic. In the same way, the young population was affected due to the blockades and restrictions that were proposed to avoid contagion. Also, low-paid workers are more exposed to contracting the virus, since they do not have the opportunity to continue their work virtually. This Gallup poll provides various patterns of consequences. As a result, subjective evaluations of life can be said to decrease for people with low income and poor health. It is difficult to obtain evidence from everywhere at the national level because homeless people, prisoners, etc. are excluded from the surveys. Likewise, the face-to-face interview to telephone calls altered the characteristics of the respondents. Emotions have been an important element in the times of the coronavirus since an increase in negative emotions has been evidenced, but they have been delayed in the various groups of the population. Covid-19 decreased the effect of income with respect to life satisfaction; however, it increased the effects of solidarity and increased life satisfaction in those over 60 years of age. the face-to-face interview to telephone calls altered the characteristics of the respondents.

In the report, it has been shown that trust in the state produced an increase in happiness in the population. This was beneficial to people with health problems, discrimination, unemployment, etc. This could affirm that trust is a fundamental support for well-being. A measure called the “wallet question” was used to be able to measure trust in various scenarios and test perceptions of trust. This would show that measures of trust and generosity are important supports for well- being, since a country that returns the wallet has had fewer deaths. This variable provides evidence of the relationship of benevolent community and public institutions showing fundamental support for Covid-19 strategies. In the report it was possible to affirm that the fundamental determinants of subjective well-being are social and institutional trust, since they contributed to the fight against Covid-19. This means that trust promoted behaviors that would allow the population to follow rules to stop Covid-19. To explain the international differences in Covid-19 mortality rates, 2 explanatory variables were used that were divided into 2 sets (demographic circumstances and economic structure). The average age of the population, if the country is an island, exposure index are the variables of the first set. While the measures of control strategies, a woman as ruler, level of institutional trust, Gini coefficient are the variables
 of the second set. All the variables together explain the international differences in the death rate from the coronavirus. Subsequently, evidence was given that the virus is transmitted faster over shorter distances. However, the SARS experience delayed recognition of transmission through asymptomatic persons. Likewise, it has been shown that countries that support a Covid suppression strategy are more likely to have a female president. Finally, the confidence of the population is lower in countries where inequality is greater, since this is more anticipatory than inequality of happiness. the SARS experience delayed recognition of transmission through asymptomatic persons.

In short, the report was able to show that trust was a fundamental factor that linked happiness with Covid. Since of all the factors analyzed, only trust proved to important for countries to apply strategies to reduce Covid. Likewise, this factor showed that populations with greater confidence in public institutions and equal income had more success in reducing Covid. Finally, the countries that applied social distancing were more successful than the rest as they saved many lives.
Similarly, chapter 5 points out the relationship between the pandemic situation and mental health. Where, due to the pandemic, the mental health of the majority of the population was affected at the beginning of the pandemic and that in the months after the initial outbreak and confinement the trajectories improved. In addition, there is a coincidence in the early improvement of well-being or mental health by the young population as opposed to the long- lived population, which was affected to a lesser degree, but had a slower recovery. Another important factor was the population's confidence in the government. It is shown that a quick and effective response by the government comes from previous experiences with SARS. In addition, the trust that the population has with its governor allows preventive measures to be carried out more effectively. The greater trust there was in the government, the more effective it is in controlling Covid-19. Likewise benevolence, since it is estimated that a country where the return of the wallet is considered very likely, compared to a country where said return is considered very unlikely, has had almost 50 fewer deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, Although it is difficult to speculate precisely on the magnitude of the consequences for the mental health and well-being of people, since the economic impacts have been of a size that we have not seen recently in recent years. Finally, despite the different complications that arose during the Covid- 19 stage, the population showed great resilience against the pandemic, this is seen in the statistics presented in chapter 2 and confirmed in chapter 5, since evidence in most countries suggests that, after the first shock to mental health, measures across the board recovered significantly, though not completely.
