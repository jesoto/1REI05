Covid 19 is a harmful virus that spread beyond borders in 2020, bringing high
costs in economic, diplomatic, and especially social and health terms. In this
report I intend to concisely point out the main ideas of both Chapter 2 
(titled Happiness, Confidence and Deaths under covid 19) of the 2021 World 
Happiness report, written by prominent economists John F. Helliwell, Richard 
Layard, Jeffrey D. Sachs, Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, Lara B. Aknin, and Shun Wang, 
as well as the fifth Chapter (named The Wealth of Nations: Defining and 
Measuring Macroeconomic Aggregates) of the book Macroeconomics, written by 
the illustrious economists Daron Acemoglu, David Laibson, and John List. 
Likewise, I propose to identify the correspondence between both chapters.

Because of covid 19 millions of lives have been lost. 
Understandably, the average for collective sadness and worry increased
considerably. However, according to the second Chapter of the 2021 World 
Happiness report, general evaluations of life and happiness classifications 
are surprisingly stable. Happiness can be associated with the well-being of 
the person. Said well-being is, according to the 2021 World Happiness report, 
determined by six factors: income, health, someone to count on, freedom, 
generosity and trust. Thanks to Macroeconomics, this happiness report is a 
reality, but what do we call macroeconomics?

Macroeconomics is, as indicated in Chapter 5, the study of aggregate economic 
activity. A benchmark measure in the macroeconomic framework is GDP: the 
market value of final goods and services produced in a country during a given
period of time. This value is defined in three mutually equivalent ways: 
production, expenditure and income. In the book Macroeconomics it is 
emphasized that the circular flow diagram explains the three identities and
proposes a fourth identical way of measuring economic activity: the factors of
production. Firms offer goods and services based on their demand. Individuals, 
through their income, consume the supply. Therefore, they spend their money, 
but it is recovered with the remuneration of their work. In this way, that 
economic circle in which we are all immersed is formed.

Scholars of Macroeconomics have the task, for example, of differentiating 
nominal values from real values: nominal values refer to current prices, 
but real values measure the market value of economic production, keeping 
prices fixed at those of a particular base year. The GDP does not take into 
account, however, the increase in economic inequality, externalities, 
unpaid domestic work, etc. Despite these limitations, it would be unfair to 
underestimate the value of Macroeconomics, since it constitutes the evolution 
of years of doing economics based on conjectures to finally use this study to 
carry out the complex and useful task of investigating cases such as happiness 
in covid times. Indeed, the subjective and abstract nature of happiness makes 
its measurement a tedious task, but not impossible.
