The objective of the chapter is to measure and use subjective well-being to measure and explain the quality of life of people around the world. To carry out this work, the researchers used as sources the Gallup World Poll, the largest in the world, and a variety of data. The subjective well-being of each individual was measured with three tools. First, are the life evaluations, where the interviewees evaluate their life as a whole. Second, the positive emotions and, lastly, the negative emotions.

In the first place, through the three happiness rankings that contrast the data from the year 2020 with those from the 2017-2019 period, the happiness evaluations remained stable. This result shows that there was a remarkable resilience of the world population in the face of the pandemic. From the data of the 95 countries, life evaluations showed a modest increase between the period 2017-2019 and the year 2020, that is, they remained stable. There were 26 countries with significant increases and 20 with decreases. On the other hand, regarding the frequency with which people experience negative emotions, there was a significant increase, specifically, in 42 countries. Especially, worry and sadness were the emotions that showed the greatest increase with 8% and 10% respectively. In contrast, positive emotions remained unchanged. One variable to highlight was the frequency of stress, which increased in 2020.

Second, the six factors that support well-being (income, health, someone to count on, freedom, generosity, and trust) continue to do so in much the same way as in previous years. Between the 2020 data and the 2017-2019 period, there were only significant changes in some of the factors. For example, there was a considerable increase in unemployment, concentrated in the population under 30 and affecting most of those in the bottom quartile of the income distribution in their country. On the other hand, there was a reduction in the frequency in which health problems are reported, specifically, in the population over 60 years of age. In addition, COVID-19 reduced the effect of income on life satisfaction, increased the effects of generosity on happiness, and maintained the likelihood of having someone to count on.

One of the things that this analysis shows is that well-being is too complex and subjective a variable to be measured using a single factor as a predictor. On the one hand, subjective well-being was attempted to be measured with the life evaluations, the positive emotions, and the negative emotions of each interviewee. Likewise, the factors that support well-being are ugly. While Robinson and Acemoglu's book acknowledges that since there is no "official" measure of happiness, life satisfaction reports are useful, it concludes that GDP is a strong predictor of life satisfaction. However, as this research shows, to measure happiness more deeply, it is necessary to take into account many factors beyond the income or economic contribution of each individual.

Finally, trust was shown to be the key factor linking happiness and COVID-19. This is because of the six factors that support happiness, only trust played a primary role in helping countries find and implement successful strategies against the virus (measured by death rate). They carried out a model that included three variables related to trust: institutional trust, the rate of return of a wallet in the community, and income inequality. The result was that the difference in confidence between Mexico and Finland, for example, could explain a difference of 41 deaths per 100,000 in 2020, almost half of the total difference between the two countries. Trust in public institutions supports the choice and successful implementation of measures against COVID-19 because the citizens of such countries are more likely to accept the need for measures that can be drastic. An example of these drastic measures is the zero transmission policy, which, according to this report, proved to be the most successful as demonstrated by comparing the cases of New Zealand and Sweden. In addition, those societies with a higher degree of trust between families and communities can encourage behaviors that would help to continue distancing and other measures. If people believe their wallet is very likely to be returned by a neighbor or stranger, their life evaluator is higher by another 0.58 points. 

In summary, life raters and positive and negative emotions for the year 2020 were presented first. Despite an increase in negative emotions and positive emotions remaining the same, life raters remained stable.
Then, it was shown how COVID-19 affected the happiness of different subgroups of the population. Finally, the relationship between trust and well-being was analyzed. The research concludes that there is enough evidence to ensure that trust and benevolence are strong supports for well-being and even for developing successful strategies against COVID-19.
