In 2012, the United Nations began compiling the “World Happiness Report”, which examines how citizens around the world classify their subjective level of happiness. Some of the happiest countries in the world have high GDP per capita and most of the least happy are very poor. This correlation tends to be direct. Clearly, wealth and happiness seem to go together, but perhaps the important factor here is how that wealth is spent.

Higher national income goes hand in hand with higher average life satisfaction. Analyzing the scatter plot, countries with higher average national incomes tend to have higher average life satisfaction and happiness scores. In other words: people in richer countries tend to report higher life satisfaction than people in poorer countries. GDP per capita turns out to be a strong predictor of life satisfaction. Indeed, this correlation holds even if we control for other external factors or variables: richer countries tend to have higher life satisfaction than poorer countries that are comparable in terms of demographics and other measurable characteristics.

In addition, just as countries with higher GDP per capita tend to be happier, this is true internally. that is, within countries. People with higher incomes within a country tend to be happier and more satisfied than people with lower incomes in the same country.

However, this is not always the case in the richest countries. In economically more developed countries like the United States, the increase in GDP would mean a growth in people's purchasing power but would not mean a proportional increase in happiness. Indeed, the income of countries like this has doubled in recent years, but the population has not greatly increased its level of satisfaction. Therefore, in countries with a lower level of GDP, the connection between GDP and level of life satisfaction is stronger, but in countries like Finland, this correlation is weaker. The economic inequalities faced by people who belong to the countries are some of the reasons why their happiness rates do not reach the top places.

The growing inequality, both speaking of GDP and of the level of satisfaction with life and happiness index, has accentuated the gap between people who live in the same region. The relationship between happiness and income is significant for two reasons. First, in the broader context of inequality, this supports the case for distributive policies. Second, for rich countries, there may be more effective ways for society to increase happiness than simply pursuing higher economic growth.
