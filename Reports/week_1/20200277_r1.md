The field and the way of studying macroeconomics have undergone transformations over time until reaching the definition we know today. According to Acemoglu Daron, Laibson David, and John List (2021) macroeconomics is understood as the study of aggregate economic activity. It is precisely by its sophisticated analysis systems that it is possible to understand the speed of economic growth and evaluate the appropriate policies for its growth within a country, and so on.

In this way, the question arises that just as macroeconomics can examine the fluctuations of economic activity from one year to another, some of its measurement systems, such as GDP per capita, can be used to predict human happiness. Acemoglu Daron and others (2021), put forward the idea that GDP per capita is a very accurate predictor of life satisfaction. The correlation that they assume within their postulate is that the countries with the highest perception of GDP per capita are those where they declare higher rates of life satisfaction (this is evaluated on a 10-point scale).

For instance, this premise is the case of Canada, which is positioned with a high level of GDP per capita and degree of satisfaction with life, with an approximate amount of 45,000 dollars and 7.6 on the scale of life satisfaction. At this point, the principle proposed in this study would be considered valid, however, if we look at the case of Brazil, a country located with a relatively low GDP per capita of approximately 18,000 dollars and 7 on the scale of life satisfaction, we note a lack of consistency in the assumption presented.

When compared with the rest of the cases of the graph presented in chapter 5 of the book by Acemoglu Daron and others (2021), there are more countries with a GDP per capita low that maintain high scales of life satisfaction. Therefore, it should be considered that for the measurement of satisfaction with life, more elements are required to evaluate it.

At this point, it is convenient to use as a reference the information presented in the World Happiness Report (2021), chapter 2. Where to evaluate life satisfaction as an evaluation method, the examination of six factors that promote satisfaction is considered essential (income, health, someone to count on, freedom, generosity, and trust).

To demonstrate the influence of these factors, the previous cases will be taken up again. On the one hand, Canada in the ranking elaborated in this book ranks 15th in 2020 and 10th during 2017-19. In parallel, Brazil ranks 41st in 2020 and 29th in 2017-19. From these analyzes, it is observed that unlike the analysis of GDP per capita with the level of life satisfaction, the positions of both countries are divergent from that previously in that report.

If we compare the reason for the difference in speed in the decline of ranks in Brazil and Canada, we can see that it was the effects of the six factors already mentioned. This is explained because it is in those countries where the degree of inequality is relatively low, the ones that had less movement in their position during the comparison of the results of 2017-19 and 2020. Since it is these countries where, based on trust deposited in its institutions, the development of the social cohesion necessary to face this pandemic was achieved.

Eventually, based on the study of the cases of Brazil and Canada in both investigations carried out in the books dealing with the measurement of life satisfaction, it can be seen that the first study focuses on a more material logic. That is, the assumption is followed that the higher the economic income of a person, the greater the degree of satisfaction. However, as evidenced by the example of Brazil, despite not having such a high income, people can feel more satisfied. 

There would arise the prerogative of how do they feel satisfied without money being the main reason? At this point, thanks to the analysis of the World Happiness Report, we will be able to find new elements that allow said personal fulfillment and they must be promoted within the countries for a more egalitarian development and humanitarian.
